# Install Hermes on an Android phone: instructions for an AI agent

**Human:** plug your phone into your computer and give your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI…) this prompt:

```text
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarqaterge/hermes-mobile-app/main/AGENT_INSTALL.md and follow it to set up Hermes on my Android phone.
```

Everything below is for the agent.

---

## Your job

Set up, on the user's Android phone, from their computer (macOS, Windows or Linux) over `adb`:

1. **Termux** (a Linux terminal app) with **Debian** inside it (proot-distro).
2. **Hermes Agent** (github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) inside Debian, with a model the user chooses.
3. **Hermes Mobile** (this repo): the Hermes plugin, a supervisor script, and the Android app.

You drive the phone with `adb`: install apps, change a few settings, and type commands into Termux with
`adb shell input text`. The phone-side work is one script, [`phone/bootstrap.sh`](phone/bootstrap.sh), which reports its
progress to Android's log, so you can follow it with `adb logcat` without seeing the screen.

**Total time:** 20-45 minutes, mostly waiting for downloads and builds on the phone.

### Rules

- Tell the user what you are about to do before each numbered step, in one line. Don't ask "continue?" between steps.
- **Ask first** before: uninstalling anything, changing an existing Termux install, or anything not in this file.
- **API keys:** ask the user for the key in chat, use it only in the one command in step 7 (or `HM_KEY`), and never repeat it, write it to a
  file on the computer, or put it in a URL.
- The phone must stay **unlocked with Termux in front** while you type into it. If a typed command doesn't show up in the log,
  check the screen first (`adb shell dumpsys window | grep mCurrentFocus`) before retrying.
- On **Windows**, run the commands in PowerShell; they work as written (use `curl.exe`, not `curl`, which is an alias there).
- When something fails, read the log (step 6 says how), fix the cause, and re-run: every step is safe to repeat.

## Fast path: the setup script

Steps 1-9 below are automated in one script. Use it first; fall back to the manual steps only for the step it fails on.

1. Do step 2's "Ask the user to" part (USB debugging, Allow prompt). The script waits for the phone.
2. Ask the user how they pay for a model (step 7): a **subscription** (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Nous Portal) or an **API key**.
   Subscription: use `HM_SKIP_MODEL=1`; they sign in from the app when it opens. API key: ask for the provider, model id and key.
3. Run it **in the background** (it takes 20-45 minutes, longer than most tool timeouts), with the answers in environment variables:

   macOS / Linux:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarqaterge/hermes-mobile-app/main/tools/setup-phone.sh -o setup-phone.sh
   HM_PROVIDER=openrouter HM_MODEL=<model id> HM_KEY_NAME=OPENROUTER_API_KEY HM_KEY=<key> bash setup-phone.sh > setup.log 2>&1
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarqaterge/hermes-mobile-app/main/tools/setup-phone.ps1 -OutFile setup-phone.ps1
   $env:HM_PROVIDER='openrouter'; $env:HM_MODEL='<model id>'; $env:HM_KEY_NAME='OPENROUTER_API_KEY'; $env:HM_KEY='<key>'
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup-phone.ps1 *> setup.log
   ```

   Subscription, or no key yet? Use `HM_SKIP_MODEL=1` instead (the other `HM_` variables aren't needed): the app opens on
   **Connect Hermes to a model** the first time.
4. Read `setup.log` every minute or so. It prints `1/9` … `9/9`, the phone-side progress (`STEP …`), and ends with
   `Done.` or `ERROR: …`. On an error, fix the cause (the matching step below explains it; a screenshot of Termux is saved
   in `~/.hermes-mobile-setup/termux-error.png`) and run the script again: finished parts are skipped.
5. Finish with step 9 (ask the user to say hi, tell them the notes).

## 1. Get `adb` on the computer

Check `adb version`. If it is missing:

| OS | Install |
|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install android-platform-tools` (or the zip below) |
| Linux | `sudo apt install adb` / `sudo dnf install android-tools` / `sudo pacman -S android-tools` (or the zip) |
| Windows | `winget install Google.PlatformTools` (or the zip) |
| Any | Download https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-{darwin,linux,windows}.zip, unzip, use `platform-tools/adb` |

## 2. Connect the phone

Ask the user to:

1. Open **Settings → About phone** and tap **Build number** 7 times (on Xiaomi: **MIUI/OS version**) to unlock Developer options.
2. In **Developer options** turn on **USB debugging**. On **Xiaomi/HyperOS** also turn on **Install via USB** and
   **USB debugging (Security settings)**; without the latter, typing into Termux fails with `INJECT_EVENTS` errors.
3. Plug the phone in and tap **Allow** on the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt (tick "Always allow").

Then `adb devices` must show one device as `device` (`unauthorized` = the prompt wasn't accepted yet; nothing listed = try another
cable/port). If several are listed, pick one and pass `-s <serial>` to every adb command (or set `ANDROID_SERIAL`).

No cable? Android 11+: Developer options → **Wireless debugging** → *Pair device with pairing code*, then
`adb pair <ip:port> <code>` and `adb connect <ip:port>` (the port on the Wireless debugging screen, not the pairing one).

Check the phone fits:

```bash
adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
adb shell getprop ro.build.version.sdk
adb shell df -h /data
```

Needs `arm64-v8a`, SDK ≥ 26 (Android 8), and at least **6 GB** free. Stop and tell the user if not.

## 3. Install Termux, Termux:API, Termux:Boot and Shizuku

All four are needed: Termux runs Hermes, Termux:API lets Hermes use the phone (battery, location, clipboard, notifications, SMS…),
Termux:Boot starts Hermes after a reboot, and Shizuku gives Hermes adb-level access (screen, taps, apps, logs) **without root**.
Check what is there: `adb shell pm list packages | grep -E 'com.termux|moe.shizuku'`.

- **Not installed:** download the current builds from F-Droid and install them. Find each version code with
  `https://f-droid.org/api/v1/packages/<package>` (field `suggestedVersionCode`), then:

  ```bash
  curl -fL -o termux.apk https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_<suggestedVersionCode>.apk
  curl -fL -o termux-api.apk https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux.api_<its suggestedVersionCode>.apk
  curl -fL -o termux-boot.apk https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux.boot_<its suggestedVersionCode>.apk
  curl -fL -o shizuku.apk https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases/download/v13.6.0/shizuku-v13.6.0.r1086.2650830c-release.apk
  adb install termux.apk && adb install termux-api.apk && adb install termux-boot.apk && adb install shizuku.apk
  ```

  (Termux is ~110 MB.) Termux:Boot only works after it was opened once: `adb shell am start -n com.termux.boot/.BootActivity`.
- **Already installed:** check `adb shell dumpsys package com.termux | grep versionName`. 0.118 or newer is fine, use it as is.
  Older (e.g. 0.101 from the Play Store) is broken: ask the user before uninstalling it, because that deletes everything in it.
  Termux:API and Termux:Boot must come from the same source as Termux (F-Droid with F-Droid), or Android refuses to install them.

## 4. Prepare Android

```bash
adb shell svc power stayon true
adb shell cmd appops set com.termux RUN_ANY_IN_BACKGROUND allow
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.termux
```

Keeps the screen on during the install (undone in step 9) and stops Android from killing Termux in the background.

Give Termux the files permission (Hermes reads and saves files through it), start Shizuku the way its own *Start by connecting
to a computer* does, and let Shizuku restart itself after a reboot (Android 13+, once the user starts it via Wireless debugging):

```bash
adb shell pm grant com.termux android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
adb shell pm grant com.termux android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
adb shell 'p=$(pm path moe.shizuku.privileged.api | head -1 | cut -d: -f2); "$(dirname "$p")/lib/arm64/libshizuku.so"'
adb shell pm grant moe.shizuku.privileged.api android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
adb shell ps -A -o NAME | grep -x shizuku_server    # prints the name when Shizuku runs
```

Android 12+ also kills apps with "too many" child processes ("[Process completed (signal 9)]" in Termux), which breaks the
install. Turn that off (SDK ≥ 31):

```bash
adb shell device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent
adb shell device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647
adb shell settings put global settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false
```

(The last line only exists on Android 14+; an error from it on older versions is fine.)

## 5. Start Termux and run the installer

Open Termux once so it unpacks itself (~30 s, needs internet):

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.termux/.app.TermuxActivity
```

**How to type into Termux.** `adb shell input text` types into whatever is in front. Spaces must be written as `%s`, and the
whole text goes in single quotes inside double quotes so the phone's shell passes `&&`, `|`, `$` through untouched. Avoid `'`
and `%` in typed text. Press Enter with `adb shell input keyevent 66`. Example:

```bash
adb shell "input text 'echo%shello%s&&%sls'"
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

**Wait until Termux is ready**: clear the log, type a probe, and check it arrived; repeat every 10 s for up to 3 minutes:

```bash
adb logcat -c
adb shell "input text '/system/bin/log%s-t%shmsetup%sready'"
adb shell input keyevent 66
adb logcat -d -s 'hmsetup:*'
```

Once `ready` shows up, type the installer (one line):

```bash
adb shell "input text 'curl%s-fsSL%shttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarqaterge/hermes-mobile-app/main/phone/bootstrap.sh%s-o%shm.sh%s&&%sbash%shm.sh'"
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

## 6. Follow the installer

```bash
adb logcat -d -s 'hmsetup:*'
```

Run that every 30-60 s (`-d` prints and exits; don't leave `adb logcat` streaming). Lines look like `HMSETUP STEP <name> …`.
Steps: `packages` → `debian` → `hermes` (the long one, 10-30 min) → `plugin` → `start`, then **`HMSETUP DONE`**.

During `plugin` (`HMSETUP phone: …` lines), Shizuku asks on the phone whether Termux may use it: ask the user to tap **Allow all
the time** (the installer waits up to a minute). `HMSETUP TODO …` lines just before `DONE` name what Hermes still can't reach
(files, Termux:API, Shizuku) and how to fix it; fix it and re-run `bash hm.sh`.

**`HMSETUP FAIL <step> (line N)`:** the real error is on the Termux screen. Read it with a screenshot
(`adb exec-out screencap -p > screen.png`), or scroll back in Termux. Common causes:

| Failure | Fix |
|---|---|
| any step, "Could not resolve host" / timeouts | Phone has no internet, or a flaky mirror: type `termux-change-repo`, pick another mirror, re-run `bash hm.sh` |
| `[Process completed (signal 9)]` | Phantom process killer: do the step 4 commands, open a new Termux session (`exit`, reopen), re-run `bash hm.sh` |
| `hermes`, "bootstrap Python lookup failed" | proot quirk; `hm.sh` already retries once with a workaround. If it still fails, re-run `bash hm.sh` |
| `hermes`, `cpython-…-linux-android` / "Target triple not supported" | Debian is using Termux's Python: check `/etc/profile.d/zz-no-termux-path.sh` exists in Debian (hm.sh writes it), then re-run |
| `hermes`, exit 132 / "Illegal instruction" | The CPU lacks an instruction a library needs. Seen only on the Android emulator on Apple Silicon, not on phones |
| `hermes`, anything else | Hermes's own installer failed. The output above names the stage; full log in Debian at `/root/.hermes/logs/install.log`. Fix it inside Debian (`proot-distro login debian`), then re-run `bash hm.sh` |
| `start` (dashboard not answering) | Look at `~/logs/dashboard.log` in Termux (`tail -50 ~/logs/dashboard.log`) |

To re-run, type `bash hm.sh` + Enter. It skips what is done.

## 7. Choose the model

Ask the user how they want to pay for the model:

- **A subscription** (ChatGPT Plus / Pro or Codex, Claude Pro / Max, SuperGrok / X Premium+, Nous Portal): skip this step. When the
  app first opens it shows **Connect Hermes to a model**, where the user signs in themselves (ChatGPT, Grok and Nous in the app;
  Claude opens Termux with Hermes's own `hermes auth add anthropic`). Never handle their account login yourself.
- **An API key:** ask which provider and for the key. Easy default: **OpenRouter** (one key, every model,
  https://openrouter.ai/keys). Others: `anthropic` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `openai` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), `gemini`
  (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, has a free tier), `deepseek` (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`). Ask the user which model they want; ids are the
  provider's own (OpenRouter lists them at https://openrouter.ai/models). Then type (with the real values, `<model>` included):

```bash
adb logcat -c
adb shell "input text 'bash%shm.sh%smodel%sopenrouter%s<model>%sOPENROUTER_API_KEY=<key>'"
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

Wait for `HMSETUP MODEL SET` in the log. Then wipe the key from the screen and Termux's history:

```bash
adb shell "input text 'history%s-c%s&&%sclear'"
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

The user can change all of this later in the app: Settings → Subscriptions & accounts / API keys / Default models.

## 8. Install the app

```bash
curl -fL -o hermes-mobile.apk https://github.com/omarqaterge/hermes-mobile-app/releases/latest/download/hermes-mobile.apk
adb install -r hermes-mobile.apk
adb shell pm grant com.omarqaterge.hermesmobile com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND
adb shell pm grant com.omarqaterge.hermesmobile android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.omarqaterge.hermesmobile
adb shell am start -n com.omarqaterge.hermesmobile/.MainActivity
```

`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` means an older self-built copy is installed: ask the user before uninstalling it
(`adb uninstall com.omarqaterge.hermesmobile`).

## 9. Check it works, then clean up

1. The app should show the chat screen within a minute, not "Hermes is offline". If it does show offline, it opens a
   **Setup check** screen by itself: take a screenshot and fix what it marks red. Otherwise open it (tap the dot next to the
   chat title → Setup check) and check the last three rows: files, Termux:API, Shizuku.
2. If step 7 was skipped, the app shows **Connect Hermes to a model**: let the user sign in or paste a key there and pick a model.
3. Ask the user to send "hi" in the app. A streamed answer means the install is complete.
4. Put the phone back:

   ```bash
   adb shell svc power stayon false
   ```

5. Tell the user, briefly:
   - On **Xiaomi/HyperOS** also turn on **Autostart** for Termux and Hermes Mobile (Settings → Apps), or Android may still stop them.
   - The **Termux notification must stay**: Hermes runs inside Termux.
   - **Shizuku stops when the phone restarts.** Without root: start it once in Shizuku → *Start via Wireless debugging* (pair
     once); on Android 13+ it then restarts by itself on Wi-Fi. Rooted: Shizuku → *Start*, and it restarts by itself. The app's
     Setup check shows when it isn't running. No root is needed for anything.
   - Hermes Mobile can be the phone's assistant (long-press power opens voice chat): Settings → Default apps → Digital assistant app.
   - Updating later: in Termux, `bash hm.sh` (phone side) and install the newer APK from the Releases page.
6. Delete the downloaded `.apk` files from the computer.

Report to the user what was installed, the model, and anything you skipped or that didn't work.
