# Manual tests

Checks that need a person, a voice, extra hardware or another computer, so they can't be run over adb.
Tick an item off (or note what went wrong) once it's done; the status per feature is in `improvements.md`.

## Voice (Live mode)

- [ ] **Approval by voice (#33).** Start Live mode in a test chat and say "run chmod 777 /tmp/x".
      Expected: Hermes asks "Hermes needs your permission. Allow or deny?" (short, not the whole command);
      saying "allow" runs it, "deny" refuses it. Say something unclear twice: the approval sheet appears instead.
- [ ] **Live mode in the background.** While Hermes is speaking in Live mode, press Home.
      Expected: it keeps speaking to the end; Live mode is off when you come back to the app.

## Read-aloud controls

- [ ] **Lock screen.** Tap Read aloud on a long reply, lock the phone.
      Expected: the player is on the lock screen; Pause/Play, back 10 s and forward 10 s work.
- [ ] **Headset.** Same, with Bluetooth or wired headphones: the play/pause button pauses and resumes; next/previous
      (double/triple press) jump 10 s forward/back.
- [ ] **Paused card swiped away.** Pause the reading from the notification, swipe the card away.
      Expected: the reading stops; the app shows no player any more.
- [ ] **Assistant from the lock screen / headset.** With Hermes as the digital assistant app (long-press power while
      unlocked already works), lock the phone and long-press power; also press a headset's voice-assistant button.
      Expected: Hermes opens in Live mode (after unlocking, if the phone asks).

## Setup on other machines

- [ ] **Windows.** Run `tools/setup-phone.ps1` on a Windows PC with a phone connected over USB debugging.
      Expected: it completes; the app's Setup check shows files, Termux:API and Shizuku green.
- [ ] **A brand-new real phone.** Run `tools/setup-phone.sh` against a freshly reset (or never-used) Android phone.
      Expected: same as above, and a first message gets a reply. (The emulator run can't check vendor battery
      restrictions or a real Shizuku start.)

## Needs a release tag

- [ ] **In-app update.** After the next `v*` release: Settings → Check for updates offers it; Download and install
      work and the app reopens on the new version.

## Rare situations

- [ ] **Expired login renewed from the model picker.** When a provider login expires, open the model picker on
      that provider. Expected: it renews the login (or asks to) and the next message works.
- [ ] **Older chats (#7).** Once there are more than 80 chats: "Show older chats" appears at the bottom of the
      drawer and loads the next ones.
- [ ] **Compress (#17).** In a long chat whose context is at least 80% full, tap the Compress suggestion.
      Expected: a notice like "Context compressed: N → M messages" and the chat continues normally.

## Background apps (phone_app)

- [ ] **While you use the phone.** Watch a video, then by voice or from a chat ask Hermes to do something in an app
      (e.g. add a Keep note). Expected: the video keeps playing, no keyboard pops up, the chip says "Using <app>",
      the task gets done.
- [ ] **Locked phone.** Same with the screen locked (it worked in a test with the screen off; a real task not yet).
- [ ] **App lock.** An app behind HyperOS's app lock is refused with "protected by an app lock": decide whether to
      take it out of the lock for Hermes.
- [ ] **A banking app with the Settings toggle on** (opens; FLAG_SECURE screens may show black in the live view).
